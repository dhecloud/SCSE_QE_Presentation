## How I prepared for my QE presentation and report for my SCSE QE

#### a) Preclude
The first thing I did was to have a look at Khassan's slides and presentation on Prof Chng Eng Siong's [homepage](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/my_Students.html). These were extremely helpful and allowed me to plan in my head how i wanted my presentation and content to flow.

Then, I proceeded to draft my talking points for each chapter/paragraph. These talking points were crucial for me to sieve the out important content from the fluff. This allowed me to only include significant information in my presentation, given that there was a time limit. Futhermore, I did not want to overload (and possibly bore) the examiners.

#### b) Report
After determining my talking points, I went ahead with writing my report. Given there is already sort of a content flow in the talking points, all I needed to do was to follow my points, and add in information, evidence, citations in areas i thought could be elaborated on. The report was the easiest to do in my opinion, but that could be just because i have an affinity for writing/reading.

#### c) Presentation
As for the presentation, I wanted to deliver my content fluidly while not potentially inducing boredom in the examiners. Personally, I have always felt that a powerpoint slide should always be graphical and understandable from a glance (have glance value). The bulk of the content should explained/said by yourself. This was the approach i went with. I also included 'milestone slides' (like slide 29), which were slides which aimed to not just provide a summary of the previous few slides, but also acted a 'breather' for the minds of those listening. I also did my best to provide graphs in place of tables for experimental results, and color schemes to make results more intuitive.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Prof Chng Eng Siong, my supervisor, who helped me through revising my report through multiple iterations.
